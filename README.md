# NIRS Brain Data Prediction
The competition hosted by DACON was open from 15.05.2020 to 26.06.2020 and attracted 690 teams. The aim of the data analysis is to predict multiple targets(concentrations of Hhb, HbO2, Ca and Na) by near-infrared spectroscopy(NIRS) data. The evaluation matric is MAE.

This code which ranked top 9% consists of three parts; feature engineering(dataset.py), LightGBM models(model.py) and implementation(main.py). 

## What is NIRS?(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-infrared_spectroscopy)
Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a spectroscopic method that uses the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Typical applications include medical and physiological diagnostics and research including blood sugar, pulse oximetry, functional neuroimaging, sports medicine, elite sports training, ergonomics, rehabilitation, neonatal research, brain computer interface, urology (bladder contraction), and neurology (neurovascular coupling). There are also applications in other areas as well such as pharmaceutical, food and agrochemical quality control, atmospheric chemistry, combustion research and astronomy.
